* Goal: Export backend for CV
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: goal
  :END:
This project exports an org-mode file with reasonably structured items into
a latex file, which compiles into a nice CV. In the same spirit the
org-mode file may export to markdown so that it can be used for a web based
CV.

- Online documentation in [[https://titan-c.gitlab.io/org-cv/]]
- Development happens in the gitlab repository: https://gitlab.com/Titan-C/org-cv
- There is a mirror in github for backup: https://github.com/Titan-C/org-cv

This project dog feeds itself and produces the examples on this
documentation page directly.

* Installation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: installation
  :END:
This project is not on MELPA so you have to do a manual installation. First
clone this git repository.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/Titan-C/org-cv.git
#+END_SRC

There are various modules to perform the export. As of now =ox-moderncv=,
=ox-altacv=, =ox-hugocv=. Choose any or all that you prefer for install. I
use =use-package= to manage the installation for example of =ox-moderncv=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ox-moderncv
    :load-path "path_to_repository/org-cv/"
    :init (require 'ox-moderncv))
#+END_SRC

* Basic Org file
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: basic_config
  :END:
The basic structure of an org file containing your CV is shown next.
** Personal contact information
=TITLE=, =AUTHOR= and =EMAIL= are standard org options. But on =TITLE= you
put your foreseen job.

You can use org-modes hierarchical structure to describe your CV. To make a
specific subtree an item describing an experience point (Job you have,
degree you pursued, etc.) you use the org properties drawer and with the
=:CV_ENV: cventry= property. You should also include the =FROM= and =TO=
properties defining the span of the event, as =LOCATION= and =EMPLOYER=.
#+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle workcontent.org
,* Employement
,** One job
:PROPERTIES:
:CV_ENV: cventry
:FROM:     <2014-09-01>
:TO:     <2017-12-07>
:LOCATION: a city, a country
:EMPLOYER: The employer
:END:

I write about awesome stuff I do.
,** Other job
:PROPERTIES:
:CV_ENV: cventry
:FROM:     <2013-09-01>
:TO:     <2014-08-07>
:LOCATION: my city, your country
:EMPLOYER: The other employer
:END:

I write about awesome stuff I do.

#+END_SRC
* Latex Exporter
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: latex_export
  :END:

** Using modern-cv
[[https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv][moderncv]] is a standard \(\LaTeX\) package that you can find in many of your
latex distributions. I maintain a fork of it, to work with my use case at
https://github.com/Titan-C/moderncv.git Feel free to use any or even your
personal fork for your desired use case.

To configure the export for moderncv you need the addition options in your
org file.
#+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle moderncv.org
# CV theme - options include: 'casual' (default), 'classic', 'oldstyle' and 'banking'
,#+CVSTYLE: banking
# CV color - options include: 'blue' (default), 'orange', 'green', 'red', 'purple', 'grey' and 'black'
,#+CVCOLOR: green
#+END_SRC

# Next block is to generate exports
#+BEGIN_SRC org :exports none :tangle moderncv.org
#+include: basic_cv.org
#+include: sideactivities.org
#+include: workcontent.org
#+END_SRC
When exporting you can call the following function to get the latex file.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-export-to-file 'moderncv "moderncv.tex")
(org-latex-compile "moderncv.tex")
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXPORT md
<object data="moderncv.org.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="500px">
<p>Alternative text - include a link <a href="moderncv.org.pdf">to the PDF!</a></p>
</object>
#+END_EXPORT
** Using alta-cv
[[https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV][AltaCV]] is another project to generate a CV, you will need to install it
yourself. I maintain a fork too at https://github.com/Titan-C/AltaCV.git
because I need extra features and I encourage to use this fork on the
=sections= branch.

The style of this CV is more involved and you need some configuration in
your org file to get it to work. First define the margins, the large margin
to the right is to allow for a second column.
#+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle altacv.org
,#+LATEX_HEADER: \geometry{left=1cm,right=9cm,marginparwidth=6.8cm,marginparsep=1.2cm,top=1.25cm,bottom=1.25cm}
#+END_SRC
# Next block is to generate exports
#+BEGIN_SRC org :exports none :tangle altacv.org
#+include: basic_cv.org
#+END_SRC
Content on the right column has the same structure of a org file, but you
need to enclose it in the =\marginpar{}= command as shown next.
#+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle altacv.org
,#+latex: \marginpar{
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle sideactivities.org

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-export-to-file 'altacv "altacv.tex")
(org-latex-compile "altacv.tex")
#+END_SRC

#+END_EXPORT

* Markdown Hugo Exporter
  :PROPERTIES:
  :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: hugo_export
  :END:
If your target is not a PDF file but a website, this exporter extends the
[[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] exporter backend. So be sure to install that too.

To export, there is nothing fancy to keep track of, but as an example I
exclude some tags during export.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((org-export-exclude-tags '("noexport" "latexonly")))
     (org-export-to-file 'hugocv "hugocv.md"))
#+END_SRC
