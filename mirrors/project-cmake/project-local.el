;;; Commentary:

;; This package extents `project` to define project-local variables,
;; much like dir-local variables already do. Those variables are
;; stored into a .project.el file at the root of the project, without
;; the cumbersome syntax of dir-local variables, but rather as a
;; series of `defvar` statements.
